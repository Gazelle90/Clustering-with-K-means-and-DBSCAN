## Clustering-with-K-means-and-DBSCAN


This project involves applying the K-Means clustering algorithm to a dataset of mall customers. Additionally, we highlight the presence of numerous outliers in the dataset, which may influence the clustering results.

## Features of the Code

# Normalization

The dataset is normalized to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process.

# Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters

The elbow method is used to determine the appropriate number of clusters by plotting the inertia for different values of k (number of clusters).

# K-Means Clustering

Clustering is performed using the scikit-learn KMeans implementation.

Cluster labels are assigned to the original dataset.

# Centroid Conversion

The centroids from the normalized feature space are converted back to the original feature space for interpretability.

# Handling Outliers

The dataset contains a significant number of outliers, which may distort the clustering results. This aspect should be carefully considered when analyzing the clusters.

## Key Steps

- Load and Normalize the Dataset

The input dataset is normalized to bring all features to a comparable scale.

- Determine Optimal Clusters

The elbow method is applied to visualize and select the optimal number of clusters.

- Apply K-Means Algorithm

K-Means is applied with the selected number of clusters.

- Analyze Results

Cluster labels are added to the dataset.

Centroids are computed and converted to the original scale.

- Outlier Awareness

Be aware of the numerous outliers in the dataset, which can impact the positioning of cluster centroids and the overall clustering performance.

## Instructions

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

# How to Run

Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and loaded correctly.

Execute the code to visualize the elbow method and decide on the number of clusters.
